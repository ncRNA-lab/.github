### 🧬 Non-Coding RNA-mediated Regulatory Networks Lab

Welcome to the Non-Coding RNA-mediated Regulatory Networks Lab at the [Institute for Integrative Systems Biology](https://www.uv.es/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i2sysbio/en/institute-integrative-systems-biology-i-sysbio.html) in 📍Valencia, Spain. Our research focuses on deciphering the regulatory pathways mediated by non coding RNAs for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allow crops to respond and eventually adapt to biotic and abiotic stress conditions.

This repository contains code, scripts, and data produced by our lab. Our lab's website can be found at https://www.ncrnalab.com/.

Please contact Julia Corell (julia.corell@csic.es) for any questions or comments.

Thank you for your interest in our work! 🙏
